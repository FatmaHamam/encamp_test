            <p class="justify">Golden paddy fields, hilly terrains, breezy air and the irresistible charm of being in Northeast India – yup, that sounds like Ziro Valley in Arunachal Pradesh. The land of Apatani Tribe, they say, the best time to visit Ziro is during its famed annual Ziro Festival of Music that celebrates soulful music mostly in the genre of indie rock. The four-day music festival started in the year 2012 and ever since, the month of September in Ziro stands witness to patrons of the festival coming in huge numbers from all parts of Northeast as well as other parts of India and overseas, year after year; making it the coolest outdoor music festival of the hills.<br><br>

            <p class="justify text-center" style="color:grey;"><i><b>The Ziro Festival of Music 2019 is going live on 26th September (continuing till 29th September)<br> and will go on to become the eighth edition, its anticipation growing bigger than<br> ever!</b></i><br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p class="justify">
                From Day 1 of the festival till the fourth day, ZFM comes to life right from daytime. The festival ground warms up with music reverberating off the two stages; Danyii setting the base in day light, engulfing the audience in a melodious trance, whereas the mainstage, Piilo puts the crowd in motion as the evening sky takes over the ambiance.<br><br><br>
